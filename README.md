# Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025 - Day 3: API Integration and Data Migration

## Overview
This project is part of the **Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025**, and Day 3 focuses on **API Integration and Data Migration**. During this session, participants will learn how to integrate external APIs into their marketplace application and perform data migrations to ensure seamless data flow between legacy systems and the new marketplace platform.

## Objectives
- **API Integration:** Connect the marketplace application to third-party APIs, fetch or post data using RESTful API calls.
- **Data Migration:** Migrate existing data into the new applicationâ€™s format or from legacy systems to a modern database.
- **Error Handling and Testing:** Implement robust error handling and perform validation to ensure data integrity during migration.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of **REST APIs** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Familiarity with **JavaScript/TypeScript**.
- Understanding of **SQL/NoSQL** databases.
- **Node.js** environment with a code editor (e.g., VS Code).
- Existing project setup with necessary dependencies.

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/panaverse/learn-nextjs.git
    cd learn-nextjs/HACKATHONS/Marketplace_Builder_Hackathon_2025
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file to configure environment variables:
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    DATABASE_URI=your_database_connection_string_here
    ```

## API Integration

### Understanding the API
Before integration, review the third-party API documentation. Understand the **base URL** and **endpoints** used for connecting to external services.

### Authentication & Authorization
Most APIs require **API keys** or **OAuth** tokens for secure access. Set up the necessary headers to authenticate requests:
```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
const headers = {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
};
Endpoints and Usage
GET Request:

javascript
Copy
Edit
fetch('https://api.example.com/products', { headers })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
POST Request:

javascript
Copy
Edit
fetch('https://api.example.com/products', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'New Product', price: 29.99 }),
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
Error Handling
Ensure that you:

Validate response codes.
Implement retry mechanisms in case of network failure.
Log errors for debugging purposes.
Data Migration
Data Sources
Identify the legacy data sources and target databases to migrate from and to.

Migration Strategies
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Outline steps to extract data, transform it into the required format, and load it into the new database.
Incremental vs. Bulk Migration: Decide on migrating in bulk or incrementally to avoid downtime.
Migration Tools and Scripts
You can write migration scripts in Node.js or Python to automate the process:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const migrateData = async () => {
  const legacyData = await fetchLegacyData();
  const transformedData = transformData(legacyData);
  await loadDataToDatabase(transformedData);
};
Validation and Testing
Ensure that data is accurately migrated by:

Validating integrity before and after migration.
Running automated tests to compare legacy and migrated data.
Having a rollback plan for potential failures.
Implementation Steps
Set Up Environment: Configure API keys and database URIs.
Develop API Integration: Implement functions for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE API operations.
Create Data Migration Scripts: Write scripts to extract, transform, and load data.
Testing and Debugging: Test APIs using Postman and validate the migration.
Documentation and Review: Update code comments and documentation for clarity.
Troubleshooting
API Errors: Ensure the API key/token is valid and check the API rate limits.
Data Mismatch: Ensure correct data types and formats.
Network Issues: Implement retry mechanisms and diagnose network errors using debugging tools.
Conclusion
Day 3 focuses on API Integration and Data Migration, helping participants integrate third-party APIs into their marketplace application and efficiently migrate data to the new platform.
